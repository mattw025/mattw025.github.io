I am a historian working in the public [environmental humanities](#environmental-humanities), an interdisciplinary field that links closely with
debates within law, politics, and Indigenous history. I am currently a [digital humanities](#digital-humanities) postdoctoral reseacher at the [Treatied Spaces Research Group](https://treatiedspaces.com), where I work with [Kingâ€™s Digital Lab](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk) and [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) to develop a range of innovative and interactive digital projects that utilise historical maps and documents to communicate original research in a new and accessible manner. My projects visualise complex jurisdictions and treatied spaces: using map layers and data overlays, I construct mapping projects that show how different concepts of sovereignty and shared commons intersect and interact with each other, on the local, national and the international level.

I ground my practice with a background in [meaning-making](#meaning-making) in history, incorporating techniques such as discourse analysis and approaches from memory studies and cultural history. My PhD in History at [Cambridge](https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk) investigated the impact of trauma and disruption on early modern English notions of time and the future. My MSc in International Relations at the [S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies](https://www.rsis.edu.sg) examined the geographical imaginations embedded in the Antarctic and Outer Space Treaty negotiations.

As a public historian, I work with museum partners including the [American Museum & Gardens](https://americanmuseum.org) and the [North American Native Museum](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/kultur/en/index/institutionen/native_american_and_inuit_cultures.html) to enhance the interpretation and contextualization of Indigenous materials in their collections. I lead my research group's policy support efforts, translating our experience in [Knowledge Exchange](https://treatiedspaces.com/knowledge-exchange) into briefs and submissions for the UK Government and Parliament. 

I am Associate Editor of [*Elements in Indigenous Environmental Research*](https://www.cambridge.org/eier), published by Cambridge University Press. I am an Associate Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk) (AFHEA), an Early Career Researcher member of the [Royal Historical Society](https://royalhistsoc.org), and a Member of the [AHRC Peer Review College](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/guidance-for-reviewers/peer-review-college).
