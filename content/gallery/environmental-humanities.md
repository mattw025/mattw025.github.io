**Indigenous environmental research:** I am Associate Editor of [*Cambridge Elements in Indigenous Environmental Research*](https://www.cambridge.org/eier). It offers state-of-the-art interdisciplinary analyses within the rapidly growing area of Indigenous environmental research, and is aimed at researchers, policy-makers and NGOs. The series investigates how environmental issues and processes relate to Indigenous socio-economic, cultural and political dynamics. We invite submissions on topics like traditional ecological knowledge, resource management, food systems, and more. More details on the [Series page](https://www.cambridge.org/eier).

**Sustainability in orbital space:** I am currently exploring discourses of sustainability in orbital space, particularly around our memory of space debris incidents including the 1978 de-orbiting of Kosmos 954 and the introduction of Hydrazine into Baffin Bay by European space launches in the 2010s.
