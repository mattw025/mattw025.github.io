Using historical sources, I excavate the mental worlds of the past across a wide range of time. 

**Early modern temporality**: In my PhD dissertation ['The impact of the regicide of Charles I on contemporary English notions of time and the future'](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.46314) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk), I examined the execution of King Charles I in 1649 as a moment of ideational change and adaptation. Taking a diachronic approach to periodicals like almanacs and newsbooks, I traced how ideas of time and the future evolved in response to unexpected political change. My research is published in [*Historical Research*](https://academic.oup.com/histres/article-abstract/94/266/758/6368094) (2021, open access) and the dissertation is available on the [Cambridge  repository](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/299249). My PhD was supervised by [Dr David Smith](https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-david-l-smith). 

**Geographies of knowledge in diplomacy**: My MSc research at the [S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies](https://www.rsis.edu.sg) examined diplomatic records to analyse geopolitical imaginations of Antarctica and Outer Space, and how they translated into the international treaties that govern these spaces today.
