**Historical GIS:** I work mainly with historical geographical information systems (GIS), georeferencing and performing data capture on historic maps to create a digital interactive ['kinetic map'](https://treatiedspaces.com/digital-storytelling/#kinetic-map). This sequential, dynamic and interactive animation will reveals how the treaty process drove the transformation of the Northeast American political and intercultural landscape over 230 years. 

**Machine learning maps:** I lead a collaborative project with the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) to explore how we can use machine learning to automatically recognise text on pre-20th century colonial maps. By comparing these map annotations, we will build a 'genealogy' of maps to help recover and quantify Indigenous contributions to European cartographic knowledge.

**Crowd-sourced research:** I am co-lead on [Mapscapes](https://treatiedspaces.com/digital-storytelling/#zooniverse-platform), a people-powered research project that invites volunteers to recover the Indigenous cultural geography of the American Northeast. Using a range of historic sources, volunteers find, locate, and position the names the Haudenosaunee and other Indigenous nations used to denote the villages, towns, and significant places within their homelands.
