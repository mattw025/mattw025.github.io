<h2>Green Toolkit for a New Space Economy</h2>
<p>A project to create a toolkit for UK SMEs in the space sector to gauge the impact on their activities on the environment and human society. This is a novel intervention that incorporates socio-cultural values into traditional environmental impact assessments. The project draws upon my research group’s expertise in Indigenous studies and promotes social justice in a format familiar and legible to business and regulatory audiences, while also providing a tool to help SMEs become more competitive by accrediting their socially responsible choices.</p>
<p>This project brings together academic collaborators in Law, Physics, Cybersecurity and User Design from the Universities of Edinburgh, Southampton, and York St John. In partnership with business (a UK space SME), the project team will create a ‘Green Toolkit for a New Space Economy’, which will help space SMEs navigate the regulatory landscape, and nudge businesses towards choices that reduce their adverse socio-cultural and environmental impact.</p>
<p>For this work, I was awarded the University of Hull’s Best Knowledge Exchange Postdoc prize in 2022.</p>
