      <description>Using historical sources, I excavate the mental worlds of the past across a wide range of time.
Early modern temporality: In my PhD dissertation &amp;lsquo;The impact of the regicide of Charles I on contemporary English notions of time and the future&amp;rsquo; at the University of Cambridge, I examined the execution of King Charles I in 1649 as a moment of ideational change and adaptation. Taking a diachronic approach to periodicals like almanacs and newsbooks, I traced how ideas of time and the future evolved in response to unexpected political change.</description>

      <description>Historical GIS: I work mainly with historical geographical information systems (GIS), georeferencing and performing data capture on historic maps to create a digital interactive &amp;lsquo;kinetic map&amp;rsquo;. This sequential, dynamic and interactive animation will reveals how the treaty process drove the transformation of the Northeast American political and intercultural landscape over 230 years.
Machine learning maps: I lead a collaborative project with the Alan Turing Institute to explore how we can use machine learning to automatically recognise text on pre-20th century colonial maps.</description>

It offers state-of-the-art interdisciplinary analyses within the rapidly growing area of Indigenous environmental research, and is aimed at researchers, policy-makers and NGOs.

      <description>I am a historian working in the public environmental humanities, an interdisciplinary field that links closely with debates within law, politics, and Indigenous history. I am currently a digital humanities postdoctoral reseacher at the Treatied Spaces Research Group, where I work with King’s Digital Lab and The Alan Turing Institute to develop a range of innovative and interactive digital projects that utilise historical maps and documents to communicate original research in a new and accessible manner.</description>
